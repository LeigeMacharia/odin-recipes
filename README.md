My First Project

With my self journey as a Full-stack Web Developer commencing I'm starting my official project with a recipe page.

I have coded before but I have never started the whole process by creating a Github Repo and commiting.

I am excited to see how all this will turn out to be.

The project is about using the basic HTML skills that I have learnt to create a Recipe Page.

I will be using lists, links and the general outlook of a basic HTML setup.

I have created 3 recipes and used the "<a>" tag to link all the 3 webpages.

It has been a bit of a challenge, especially with the coordination of where to place the directories, commiting and pushing .

I am learning slowly by slowly, it is challenging but I enjoy it alot.

With a bit of practice I will get there.
